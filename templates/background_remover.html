							Removal of unwanted outer areas from a graphic or illustrated image; this process usually 
              consists of removing some of the peripheral regions of an image to remove extraneous trash 
              from the picture, improving its framing, and accentuating or isolating the subject matter 
              from its background.

              Background remover aims to predict a precise alpha matte used to extract people from a given 
              image or video. It has a wide variety of utilisation, such as photo editing and video 
              re-creation. Currently, in real-time, a green screen is required to obtain a high-quality 
              alpha matte.

              Here, we have a web application that uses artificial intelligence to remove the background 
              of any image or photo. It works 100% automatically, so you don't need to select the 
              background/foreground layers to separate them manually - choose or select your image and 
              instantly download the output image with the background removed.
