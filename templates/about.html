						<p>Hi, I am Sarthak Chauhan</p>
						<p>
							I am currently a Junior pursuing Integrated Masters of Technology focused in Geophysical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee. 
							For the past two years, Iâ€™ve worked on various projects and am an experienced Developer with a demonstrated history of working in the IT industry, skilled in Python, Machine Learning, API development, and Java. 
							In addition, I love to take on challenging tasks to explore the field further. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Besides machine learning and geophysics, I also like contemporary art and travelling. I believe everything is possible; you just have to make even the slightest possibility countable.
							Born and raised and trained in Dehradun, I have been highly interested in football since I was a kid and can also call me a gym freak. I May not be good at something, but I always try to do my best in all.
						</p>
						<p>
							A special thanks to Mayan Sachan, who helped me with the completion of this website. Do visit his page too.
