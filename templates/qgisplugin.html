                            The QGIS project that was initially released in 2002 is currently a mature GIS platform, that is open-source in nature, 
                            and allows people to use it for free, as well as contribute to the project, either directly in the source code of the 
                            project or as plugins that extend the core functionalities. QGIS aims to be a user-friends GIS platform, consisting of 
                            common GIS functionality (Foreword — QGIS Documentation Documentation, 2020). It is also highly extensible through a 
                            robust plugin system. New functionality and features can easily be added to QGIS by implementing a plugin. 
                            The plugin can be implemented in either C++ or Python (QGIS Plugins — QGIS Documentation Documentation, 2020). 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Here, I contributed to an open-source research-oriented QGIS Plugin with the title of <b>“Snowmelt Runoff Modeling Data 
                            Pre-Processing”</b> which was supplementary to a Masters' Thesis submitted at IIT Roorkee by Pritam Das. This 
                            was an attempt to aid researchers mainly in the field of snow-cover variability assessment and snow-melt runoff  modeling  
                            in their study. The plugin,  too,  is open-source in nature and is hosted at <a href="https://github.com/pritamd47/SMProcessing">https://github.com/pritamd47/SMProcessing</a>. It 
                            provides some easily accessible algorithms to manipulate and analyze DEM data, calculate temperature lapse rate, and apply 
                            cloud removal algorithms to daily Snow-Cover datasets. The plugin was implemented completely in Python and tools available 
                            strictly in Python.  
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The plugin has three main components. <b>(1) Persistent Output Pane</b> – This pane shows the output of various processing tasks to 
                            the user. It remains persistent across all the tabs, and the plugin uses this pane to inform the user about the tasks that 
                            are being performed as well as the output of those tasks. <b>(2) The Tabs</b> are used to group together various sets of processing 
                            tasks according to the datasets for which the tasks are performed. <b>(3) Processing Pane</b> – This area of the plugin hosts various 
                            buttons and controls that perform the actual processing tasks. This pane varies according to the tab that is selected. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The tasks performed by the plugin are divided into three categories based on the intended datasets that are to be processed. The 
                            tasks relate to Digital Elevation Model and Land Surface Temperature processing and Cloud-Removal from snow cover datasets. These 
                            processing tasks are grouped in tabs named DEM, LST, and Cloud Removal, respectively. 
                        </p>
                        <h3><br>DEM Processing</h3>
                        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/DEM1_Qgis.png') }}" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                        <P>
                            The DEM Processing tab deals with four processing options and provides a quick interface to carry out the processing tasks. Once the 
                            DEM file is added in the QGIS project as a raster layer, the name of the file will appear in the ‘DEM’ input, where it can be 
                            selected from the drop-down menu. The processing options are listed as buttons in the ‘Actions’ sub-section. 
                        </P>

                        <p>
                            The first option allows the user to export the unique values present in the DEM file in a tabular format. This is often useful in 
                            performing further calculations, such as calculation of the histogram, or generation of the hypsometric curve in any spreadsheet software 
                            such as Microsoft Excel. It lists down the unique elevation values, their counts, and the combined area (the accuracy of which is subject 
                            to the projection of the input DEM).
                            <br>
                            The second option allows the user to calculate the statistics of the DEM quickly. This provides an easy way to obtain the essential 
                            statistics of the DEM, such as the maximum value, minimum value, mean, range, and standard deviation of the DEM.  
                            <br>
                            The third option, classify, is planned to allow the user to select a range of old values that are to be classified as into certain classes 
                            in an easy to use interface. It also provides us with a histogram, which shows the interval strength of the new and old classified values.
                            <br>
                            The final option will allow the user to intersect DEM and vector layers. It will transfer the values of raster to the respective vector 
                            polygons. 
                        </p>

                        <h3><br>LST</h3>
                        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/LST_Qgis.png') }}" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                        <p>
                            The relationship between Elevation and Temperature is an important parameter in snow-melt runoff modeling studies that deal with 
                            mountainous terrain. This relationship is called the temperature lapse rate. The LST tab can calculate and list the temperature lapse 
                            rate for multiple files at once. The “Calculate Lapse Rate” will calculate the lapse rate for each file, and will write a tabular dataset 
                            containing the lapse rate corresponding to the path of each file. 
                        </P>
                        <h3><br>Cloud Processing</h3>
                        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/CloudRemoval_Qgis.png') }}" class="img-responsive" alt="">
                        <p>
                            Cloud Processing allows users to obtain cloud-removed daily snow-cover datasets using the modified  Gafurov & Bárdossy, 2009  Cloud 
                            Removal Algorithm. More granular control over the parameters, such as the length of the temporal window and the kernel size of spatial windows, 
                            are planned to be incorporated in future iterations of the plugin.
